# iclr2026-query-circuit-rebuttal

## This repo contains 5 sets of additional experimental results, each organized in a folder:

**Edge_Pruning_on_IOI/**: Demonstration and analysis on why optimization-based circuit discovery methods fail on the setting of query circuit.

**gpt2-xl_and_llama-3-8b/**: Our methods' performance on three datasets with target model as GPT2-XL and Llama-3-8B-Instruct.

**more_circuit_analysis/**: Demonstration and analysis on the relationship (1) between query and capability circuits and (2) among query circuits.

**nfs_and_ndf_on_query_and_paraphrases/**: NFS and NDF of the query circuit discovered by the original query and its paraphrases.

**rephrase_whole_queries/**: Our methods' performance on three datasets with target model as Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct when rephrasing is done on the whole query instead of only the question stem.
